# hello-world
my first git repository !description good enough?

I find this part very boring.This part where we have to describe ourselves irrespective of the context to random people. So let me just write some random things about me which nobody cares about and nobody is gonna read anyway.i love reading novels , playing badminton , football , guitar, competetive, ml, webd etc etc.fun fact:even though python has much more shorter syntax and is easy to understand and implement , i find c++ much better and i don't know why, atleast for competetive coding.
